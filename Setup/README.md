To build the Microservice, my local machine is running on ubuntu 20.04 on top of that we install our dependencies which we need

## What is maven?

Building a software project typically consists of tasks such as downloading dependencies; putting
additional jars on a classpath; compiling source code into binary code; running tests; packaging
compiled code into deployable artifacts, such as JAR, WAR, and ZIP files; and deploying these
artifacts to an application server or repository.

Apache Maven automates these tasks, which minimizes the risk of human error, while building
the software manually and separating the work of compiling and packaging our code from that
of code construction.
